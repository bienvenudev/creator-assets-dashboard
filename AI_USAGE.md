# AI Usage Log

## Tools used
- **Claude (Anthropic)** via Cline VSCode extension
- Used throughout development for code generation, debugging, and guidance

## What you used them for
1. **Project Setup**: Tailwind CSS v4, Vitest, TypeScript configuration
2. **3D Viewer Implementation**: Three.js/React Three Fiber integration (first time using 3D in web)
3. **Component Boilerplate**: Initial structure for React components
4. **Testing**: Test file setup, test cases, and mocking strategies
5. **Problem Solving**: Debugging TypeScript errors, build issues, API integration
6. **Documentation**: README structure and technical writing assistance

## Prompt links or summaries (optional)
- "How to integrate React Three Fiber with TypeScript?"
- "Extract video thumbnail using Canvas API"
- "Create Error Boundary for React component"
- "Best practices for Vitest with React Testing Library"

## What you changed manually / decisions you made
### Core Decisions (My Work):
- **Architecture**: Component hierarchy, routing structure, state management approach
- **UI/UX**: Layout design, user flows, visual styling choices
- **Business Logic**: Custom filtering/sorting algorithms, form validation rules
- **Feature Scope**: Which features to implement vs. defer (e.g., no delete/update for MVP)
- **Code Refactoring**: Simplified AI-generated code, removed unnecessary features (Grid, Wireframe)

### Learning Through AI:
- **Three.js Fundamentals** (new to me): Scene, Camera, Lights, OrbitControls
- **Modern Tooling**: Tailwind v4 CSS-based config, Vite 7, React 19 patterns
